	Abstract = {Context. Catalogue cross-correlation is essential to building large sets of multi-wavelength data, whether it be to study the properties of populations of astrophysical objects or to build reference catalogues (or timeseries) from survey observations. Nevertheless, resorting to automated processes with limited sets of information available on large numbers of sources detected at different epochs with various filters and instruments inevitably leads to spurious associations. We need both statistical criteria to select detections to be merged as unique sources, and statistical indicators helping in achieving compromises between completeness and reliability of selected associations.  Aims: We lay the foundations of a statistical framework for multi-catalogue cross-correlation and cross-identification based on explicit simplified catalogue models. A proper identification process should rely on both astrometric and photometric data. Under some conditions, the astrometric part and the photometric part can be processed separately and merged a posteriori to provide a single global probability of identification. The present paper addresses almost exclusively the astrometrical part and specifies the proper probabilities to be merged with photometric likelihoods.  Methods: To select matching candidates in n catalogues, we used the Chi (or, indifferently, the Chi-square) test with 2(n-1) degrees of freedom. We thus call this cross-match a chi-match. In order to use Bayes' formula, we considered exhaustive sets of hypotheses based on combinatorial analysis. The volume of the chi-test domain of acceptance - a 2(n-1)-dimensional acceptance ellipsoid - is used to estimate the expected numbers of spurious associations. We derived priors for those numbers using a frequentist approach relying on simple geometrical considerations. Likelihoods are based on standard Rayleigh, chi and Poisson distributions that we normalized over the chi-test acceptance domain. We validated our theoretical results by generating and cross-matching synthetic catalogues.  Results: The results we obtain do not depend on the order used to cross-correlate the catalogues. We applied the formalism described in the present paper to build the multi-wavelength catalogues used for the science cases of the Astronomical Resource Cross-matching for High Energy Studies (ARCHES) project. Our cross-matching engine is publicly available through a multi-purpose web interface. In a longer term, we plan to integrate this tool into the CDS XMatch Service.},

	Abstract = {Algorithms are developed for predicting the accuracy with which the brightness of a star can be determined from its image on a digital detector array, as a function of the brightness of the background. The assumption is made that a known profile is being fitted by least squares. The two profiles used correspond to ST images and to ground-based observations. The first result is an approximate rule of thumb for equivalent noise area. More rigorous results are then given in tabular form. The size of the pixels, relative to the image size, is taken into account. Astronometric accuracy is also discussed briefly; the error, relative to image size, is very similar to the photometric error relative to brightness.},

  abstract      = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the         optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST         design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark         energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system,         exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way.         LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to         obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro         Pach{\'o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m         (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^{2}$ field of view,         a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the         wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction         phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About         90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast         survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg$^{2}$         region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the         anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to         r {\ensuremath{\sim}} 27.5. These data will result in databases         including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies         and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority         of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the         observing time will be allocated to special projects such as         Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are         currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science         drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we         describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

  abstract      = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data         release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for         1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented         with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2.          Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented,         accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to         Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are         present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the         responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results.  Methods:         The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the         first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia         Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this         early third data release, which represents a major advance with         respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric         precision, accuracy, and homogeneity.  Results:         Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent         brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5         billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the         (G$_{BP}$ {\ensuremath{-}} G$_{RP}$) colour are also available.         The passbands for G, G$_{BP}$, and G$_{RP}$ are provided as part         of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities         from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of         a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will         appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an         updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF)         in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on         extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia         EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect         to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of         spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is         largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new         sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will         not change for Gaia DR3.  Conclusions: Gaia EDR3         represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax         precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions         increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the         astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a         factor \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2.5 for the proper         motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but         above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and         celestial position. A single passband for G, G$_{BP}$, and         G$_{RP}$ is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range,         with no systematics above the 1\% level},

Our Bayesian approach, symmetric in all observations, is the foundation of a unified framework for object matching, where not only spatial information, but also physical properties, such as colors, redshift, and luminosity, can be considered in a natural way. We provide a practical recipe to implement an efficient recursive algorithm to evaluate the Bayes factor over a set of catalogs with known circular errors in positions. This new methodology is crucial for studies leveraging the synergy of today's multiwavelength observations and to enter the time domain science of the upcoming survey telescopes.},

  abstract      = {A fundamental process in astrophysics is the matching of two photometric
catalogues. It is crucial that the correct objects be paired, and that
their photometry does not suffer from any spurious additional flux. We
compare the positions of sources in Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE), INT Photometric H {$\alpha$} Survey, Two Micron All Sky Survey and
AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey with Gaia Data Release 1 astrometric
positions. We find that the separations are described by a combination
of a Gaussian distribution, wider than naively assumed based on their
quoted uncertainties, and a large wing, which some authors ascribe to
proper motions. We show that this is caused by flux contamination from
blended stars not treated separately. We provide linear fits between the
quoted Gaussian uncertainty and the core fit to the separation
distributions. We show that at least one in three of the stars in the
faint half of a given catalogue will suffer from flux contamination
above the 1 per cent level when the density of catalogue objects per
point spread function area is above approximately 0.005. This has
important implications for the creation of composite catalogues. It is
important for any closest neighbour matches as there will be a given
fraction of matches that are flux contaminated, while some matches will
be missed due to significant astrometric perturbation by faint
contaminants. In the case of probability-based matching, this
contamination affects the probability density function of matches as a
function of distance. This effect results in up to 50 per cent fewer
counterparts being returned as matches, assuming Gaussian astrometric
uncertainties for WISE-Gaia matching in crowded Galactic plane regions,
compared with a closest neighbour match.},

  abstract    = {The matching of sources between photometric catalogues can lead to cases where objects of differing brightness are incorrectly assumed to be detections of the same source. The rejection of unphysical matches can be achieved through the inclusion of information about the sources' magnitudes. The method described here uses the additional photometric information from both catalogues in the process of accepting or rejecting counterparts, providing approximately a factor 10 improvement in Bayes' factor with its inclusion. When folding in the photometric information we avoid using prior astrophysical knowledge. Additionally, the method allows for the possibility of no counterparts to sources as well as the possibility that sources overlap multiple potential counterparts. We formally describe the probability of two sources being the same astrometric object, allowing systematic effects of astrometric perturbation (by, e.g., contaminant objects) to be accounted for. We apply the method to two cases. First, we test IPHAS-Gaia matches to compare the resulting matches in two catalogues of similar wavelength coverage but differing dynamical ranges. Second, we apply the method to matches between IPHAS and 2MASS and show that the method holds when considering two catalogues with approximately equal astrometric precision. We discuss the importance of including the magnitude information in each case. Additionally, we discuss extending the method to multiple catalogue matches through an iterative matching process. The method allows for the selection of high-quality matches by providing an overall probability for each pairing, giving the flexibility to choose stars known to be good matches.},

Wilson {\amp} Naylor showed failing to account for these shifts can lead to a drastic decrease in the number of returned catalogue matches in crowded fields. Here, we highlight the effect these perturbations have on cross-matching, for matches between Gaia DR2 and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer(WISE) stars in a crowded Galactic plane region. Applying the uncertainties as quoted to Gaussian-based astrometric uncertainty functions (AUFs) can lead, in dense Galactic fields, to only matching 55 per cent of the counterparts. We describe the construction of empirical descriptions for AUFs, building on the cross-matching method of Wilson {\amp} Naylor, utilizing the magnitudes of both catalogues to discriminate between true and false counterparts. We apply the improved cross-matching method to the Galactic plane |b| {\le} 10. We provide the most likely counterpart matches and their respective probabilities. We also analyse several cases to verify the robustness of the results, highlighting some important caveats and considerations. Finally, we discuss the effect that PSF resolution has by comparing the intra-catalogue nearest neighbour separation distributions of a sample of likely contaminated WISE objects and their corresponding Spitzer counterpart. We show that some WISE contaminants are resolved in Spitzer, with smaller intra-catalogue separations. We have highlighted the effect contaminant stars have on WISE, but it is important for all photometric catalogues, playing an important role in the next generation of surveys, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

  abstract      = {To perform precise and accurate photometric catalogue cross-matches -         assigning counterparts between two separate data sets - we need         to describe all possible sources of uncertainty in object         position. With ever-increasing time baselines between         observations, like 2MASS in 2001 and the next generation of         surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey         of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace         Romantelescope, it is crucial that we can robustly describe and         model the effects of stellar motions on source positions in         photometric catalogues. While Gaia has revolutionized astronomy         with its high-precision astrometry, it will only provide motions         for {\ensuremath{\approx}}10 per cent of LSST sources;         additionally, LSST itself will not be able to provide high-         quality motion information for sources below its single-visit         depth, and other surveys may measure no motions at all. This         leaves large numbers of objects with potentially significant         positional drifts that may incorrectly lead matching algorithms         to deem two detections too far separated on the sky to be         counterparts. To overcome this, in this paper, we describe a         model for the statistical distribution of on-sky motions of         sources of given sky coordinates and brightness, allowing for         the cross-match process to take into account this extra         potential separation between Galactic sources. We further detail         how to fold these probabilistic proper motions into Bayesian         cross-matching frameworks, such as those of Wilson \& Naylor.         This will vastly improve the recovery of, for example, very red         objects across optical-infrared matches, and decrease the false         match rate of photometric catalogue counterpart assignment.},
